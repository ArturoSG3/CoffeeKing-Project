    "2. Atmosphere: It is a subject that I saw more in positive reviews. It means that the place and location should give a unique experience. \n",
    "3. Time: Users in negative reviews speak about this subject. I believe one key factor users hate is waiting, and if a coffee shop makes them wait for more than they want to, they will notice. I recommend the business to focus on reducing the waiting time for users. "
